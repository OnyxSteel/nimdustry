# Nimdustry

A Nim version of Mindustry. Not intended to be a complete game. Partially made as a learning experience.

[The Webassembly version can be seen here.](https://anuken.github.io/nimdustry/) Don't expect anything playable yet.

# Compiling

1. Install the latest stable version of Nim and Nimble. `~/.nimble/bin` must be on your PATH.
2. `sudo apt install -y xorg-dev libgl1-mesa-dev` or equivalent packages
3. `nimble debug`

Builds are only tested on Linux. Building on Windows is not supported, although cross-compiling from Linux is possible.
